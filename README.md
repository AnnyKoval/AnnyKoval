👋 Hi, I’m Anna Koval! I live in Kyiv, Ukraine 💛💙
👀 I’m interested in coding
🌱 Currently, I am a front-end development student at "Meta Front-End developer" course by Meta and "Full Stack Software Engineer" course by IBM. Already finished the Front-End course at the SheCodes platform.
💞 I would appreciate an opportunity to broaden my knowledge by working with front-end developers as a trainee
